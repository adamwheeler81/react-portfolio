                <p>Tickr is a personalized news app that lets the user customize the flow of news to be relevant to their interests. The user will be prompted to sign in with their e-mail, and customize the type of news they want to see, organized by which countries they want their news source to be from. As a consumer, I want access to various news outlets. I want the freedom to search specific topics and have a multitude of results to choose from. The user will be prompted with a web authentication and will be able to save articles to their accounts. Separate API keys are used to grab articles from varying sources such as author, topic, news outlet, etc.</p>

                <p>This is an app for searching for gluten-free recipes and restaurants.
                  We developed this app for users to search for gluten-free recipes, and also provide a list of restaurants with similar gluten-free options.
                  As a person with certain dieting restrictions, I want to be able to search for food that fits into my diet plan, so that I wonâ€™t eat food that is potentially harmful.</p>

                <h3>Day Planner</h3>
                <p>This is a functional Day Planner application. The application displays timeblocks for standard business hours (9 a.m. to 5 p.m.). Each timeblock contains an input field and save button. Clicking a timeblock's "Save" button stores the input text in local storage, allowing the text to persist when the application is refreshed. The current day is displayed at the top of the calendar. Each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in a past, present, or future hour.</p>
